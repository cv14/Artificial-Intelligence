All the files are commented and explained.

To run the program with a sample input and display the output, compile the
MainMethod.java and run it with an input file as a command line argument.

Example code:

javac MainMethod.java

java MainMethod pa1.in

- Overall this was a great project to work on. Grateful to have the opportunity.
