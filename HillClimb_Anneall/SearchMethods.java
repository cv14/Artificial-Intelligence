SearchMethods program implements both Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing on
8-queens problems.Given an 8Ã—8 chessboard. We need to put 8 queens on it and
no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens
share the same row, column, or diagonal.

In Hill Climbing algorithm  we had  to find a successor state which have the lowest h value.
If there are  multiple equal good successor states, we just randomly move to
one of them. Else we store the currQ state as the local optimal.

For Simulated Annealing we only move to a successor state which have a high h
value .
